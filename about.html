        Hello, my name is Mark Haynes, I am currently completing a User
        Interface Engineer certification at Kenzie Academy. As of now I have a
        perfect 100 in the course. I’m looking to get a Bachelors in Front End
        Development as soon I’m done here. I also started a Front End
        Development course on Coursea which I intend to be done by the end of
        January 2021. I am interested in becoming a UI Engineer. My extra
        classes in Coursea will increase my skills at designing and developing
        websites which will come in handy in this industry. In my spare time,
        I like to spend time outdoors, and listen to all types of music. I’m
        currently a bartender, where I talk to all types of people. This helps
        me empathize with all walks of life, which is a key component in
        design. I enjoy solving problems, and working on a team. I am seeking
        a mentor in my professional career. Could you and I work together in
        the near future?
